# **Set 66: AI for Space Robotics, Planetary Exploration & Extreme Environments (Research-Level Questions)**

---

### **Q1. Why is AI essential for space robotics?**
**A1.**  
Due to communication delays (up to 20 minutes to Mars), robots must operate **autonomously**, handling navigation, perception, manipulation, and failure recovery independently.  
AI enables:  
- Real-time decision-making  
- Fault tolerance  
- Autonomous science planning  
- Robust operation in unknown terrain  

---

### **Q2. What makes perception harder in space environments compared to Earth?**
**A2.**  
- Extreme lighting variations  
- Dust storms (Mars)  
- Low texture and uniform landscapes  
- Harsh shadows  
- Lack of GPS  
Robots must rely on multisensor fusion (stereo cameras, LIDAR, RADAR, IMU) and self-supervised learning.

---

### **Q3. How does autonomous navigation work for planetary rovers?**
**A3.**  
Rovers perform:  
1. **Terrain mapping** (stereo vision, point clouds)  
2. **Hazard detection** (slopes, rocks, loose soil)  
3. **Local path planning** (A*, RRT)  
4. **Adaptive execution**  
All performed onboard with limited computing and no live human intervention.

---

### **Q4. What is visual odometry, and why is it critical for space robots?**
**A4.**  
Visual odometry estimates the rover’s motion by tracking visual features across frames.  
It's necessary because:  
- There is **no GPS** on other planets  
- Wheel slip is common  
VO + IMU fusion enables accurate localization for long missions.

---

### **Q5. How do space robots handle extreme temperature and radiation effects on AI systems?**
**A5.**  
Techniques include:  
- Radiation-hardened chips (RAD750)  
- Triple modular redundancy (TMR)

- Fault detection & self-recovery algorithms  
AI models must run efficiently under strict compute constraints.

---

### **Q6. What is “autonomous science” in planetary missions?**
**A6.**  
AI enables robots to:  
- Identify scientifically interesting samples

**A14.**  
It requires:  
- Precision manipulation  
- Contamination avoidance  
- Multi-stage rendezvous

**A15.**  
- Very low processing power (comparable to a 1990s CPU)  
- Strict thermal and radiation constraints  
- Power limitations from solar arrays  
Models must be extremely optimized, relying on:  
- Pruned networks
