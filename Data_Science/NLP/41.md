# Research-Level Multimodal / Generative AI Questions (Set 29)

## Q1. How do cross-modal attention bottlenecks limit large-scale multimodal transformer efficiency?  
**A1.**  
- Each modality (e.g., vision, audio, text) generates distinct token distributions.  
- Cross-attention layers create quadratic scaling in token count per modality.  
- Leads to inefficiency when one modality dominates (e.g., long text overshadowing short image embeddings).  
- Mitigation: modality-specific compression, hierarchical fusion, sparse cross-attention.

---

## Q2. Why is temporal coherence a major challenge in multimodal video generation?  
**A2.**  
- Generative models must ensure consistency of appearance and motion across frames.  
- Frame-by-frame generation often causes flickering or drifting artifacts.  
- Solutions: latent diffusion with temporal attention, 3D convolutions, motion priors.  
- Temporal consistency loss functions are an active research area.

---

## Q3. What are the difficulties of applying diffusion models to multimodal data (text + audio + video)?  
**A3.**  
- Synchronization across modalities (e.g., lip-sync in talking head generation).  
- Large continuous latent spaces cause misalignment in diffusion timesteps.  
- Requires cross-modal noise scheduling and joint denoising objectives.

---

## Q4. How does tokenization differ for images and videos in large multimodal transformers?  
**A4.**  
- Text uses discrete tokens, while vision uses patches or continuous embeddings.  
- Videos require spatio-temporal tokens (frame × patch × time).  
- Token explosion increases memory footprint exponentially.  
- Advanced solutions: temporal pooling, adaptive token merging, vector quantization.

---

## Q5. What are the limitations of CLIP-style contrastive training for fine-grained multimodal tasks?  
**A5.**  
- Contrastive objectives align global representations, but lose fine local details.  
- Fails in tasks needing pixel-level grounding (e.g., segmentation or referring expressions).  
- Hybrid losses (contrastive + reconstruction) improve spatial alignment.

---

## Q6. How does multimodal retrieval differ when extended to generative agents?  
**A6.**  
- Retrieval now serves as a **reasoning context**, not just search.  
- Must dynamically retrieve across modalities based on intent (e.g., retrieve both text and video).  
- Requires unified embedding spaces and adaptive retrieval filters.  
- Complex due to cross-modal domain gaps and varying embedding scales.

---

## Q7. What challenges arise when integrating symbolic reasoning into multimodal LLMs?  
**A7.**  
- Symbolic reasoning expects discrete entities and relations.  
- Multimodal embeddings are continuous, fuzzy, and high-dimensional.  
- Hybrid architectures need alignment between symbolic and sub-symbolic representations.  
- Example: connecting “image of a man holding an apple” with symbolic logic predicates.

---

## Q8. How can multimodal generative models be evaluated beyond perceptual quality metrics?  
**A8.**  
- Standard metrics (FID, IS) don’t capture semantic correctness or cross-modal alignment.  
- Need multimodal coherence metrics: grounding accuracy, temporal consistency, causal alignment.  
- Human evaluation and task-specific benchmarks are still dominant.

---

## Q9. What are the data governance risks specific to multimodal model training?  
**A9.**  
- Risk of unintentional inclusion of copyrighted or biometric data (images, voices).  
- Cross-modal linkage may expose identity even after anonymization.  
- Governance requires fine-grained provenance tracking across modalities.

---

## Q10. How do emerging 3D + text models (e.g., Point-E, Shap-E) change the paradigm of generative AI?  
**A10.**  
- Move from 2D understanding to spatial reasoning.  
- Enable physically grounded generation (3D structures, scenes).  
- Challenge: lack of large paired text-3D datasets and high rendering cost.  
- Future: integrating 3D-aware priors into multimodal LLMs for embodied AI.
