### **Q1.** What are *emergent abilities* in large language models?

**A1.**  
Emergent abilities are skills or behaviors that appear suddenly once a model reaches a certain scale (parameters or data). These abilities—like arithmetic, few-shot reasoning, or instruction following—don’t extrapolate linearly from smaller models. They likely arise due to *phase transitions* in representation learning as model capacity allows for more complex pattern abstraction.

---

### **Q2.** Explain the *attention head specialization* phenomenon in transformer interpretability.

**A2.**  
Each attention head in a transformer often learns a distinct syntactic or semantic role — such as attending to subject-verb agreement, negations, or positional markers. Analyzing heads helps interpret how models encode linguistic structure, though redundancy and overlapping functionality often exist.

---

### **Q3.** What are *inductive biases* and how do they relate to scaling laws?

**A3.**  
Inductive biases are prior assumptions embedded in model architectures or training processes (e.g., convolutional locality, attention for permutation invariance). Scaling laws describe performance improvement with size and data. Strong inductive biases can improve small models but limit scalability, while weaker ones may scale better.

---

### **Q4.** What are *alignment tax* and *capability overhang* in large models?

**A4.**  
- **Alignment tax:** The performance or efficiency cost incurred by making a model safer and more aligned with human intent.  
- **Capability overhang:** When a model already has latent abilities that are not fully accessible until fine-tuning or prompt discovery reveals them.

---

### **Q5.** Describe *chain-of-thought (CoT) distillation*.

**A5.**  
CoT distillation involves training smaller models to mimic the reasoning steps (rationales) of larger teacher models. This enhances interpretability and reasoning without requiring explicit intermediate supervision from humans.

---

### **Q6.** How does *contrastive pretraining* benefit multimodal models?

**A6.**  
Contrastive pretraining (as in CLIP) aligns embeddings from different modalities (e.g., text and image) by maximizing similarity for paired samples and minimizing it for mismatched pairs. This enables zero-shot generalization across tasks like image classification, retrieval, and captioning.

---

### **Q7.** Explain *token-level alignment vs. concept-level alignment* in multimodal systems.

**A7.**  
- **Token-level alignment:** Matches low-level visual tokens (pixels or patches) to word tokens.  
- **Concept-level alignment:** Maps higher-level semantic representations (objects, actions) to textual concepts.  
Modern architectures like BLIP-2 and Flamingo combine both for robust reasoning.

---

### **Q8.** What is *speech-to-text alignment drift*, and how do ASR systems mitigate it?

**A8.**  
Alignment drift occurs when audio frames and transcribed tokens become desynchronized during training. Techniques like Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC), attention-based alignment, and monotonic energy regularization mitigate this issue.

---

### **Q9.** How does *multimodal grounding* enhance factual reasoning in LLMs?

**A9.**  
Grounding links textual information with perceptual modalities (vision, audio, environment). This improves factual accuracy and commonsense reasoning because the model learns contextual cues directly tied to the physical or visual world.

---

### **Q10.** What are *token-free* architectures and why are they being explored?

**A10.**  
Token-free architectures (e.g., byte-level or continuous tokenization) remove discrete token boundaries, allowing smoother representation of multilingual text, speech, and visual data. They reduce preprocessing errors and improve performance on rare or unseen symbols.
