# Natural Language Processing (NLP) Questions and Answers

## 1. What is Natural Language Processing (NLP)?
**Answer:**  
NLP is a field of Artificial Intelligence that focuses on enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language. Applications include chatbots, translation systems, sentiment analysis, and speech recognition.

## 2. What are the main steps in an NLP pipeline?
**Answer:**  
1. Text Preprocessing (tokenization, lowercasing, stopword removal)  
2. Feature Extraction (Bag of Words, TF-IDF, embeddings)  
3. Model Training (ML or DL models)  
4. Post-processing (interpret results, generate text)

## 3. What is tokenization in NLP?
**Answer:**  
Tokenization is the process of breaking text into smaller units like words, subwords, or sentences.  
Example: `"I love NLP"` → `["I", "love", "NLP"]`

## 4. What are stopwords and why are they removed?
**Answer:**  
Stopwords are common words like "is", "the", "a" that do not add significant meaning. Removing them reduces noise and improves model efficiency.

## 5. What is stemming vs. lemmatization?
**Answer:**  
- **Stemming:** Removes suffixes to get the root form (e.g., `running → run`). It may produce non-dictionary words.  
- **Lemmatization:** Converts a word to its base form using vocabulary and grammar (e.g., `better → good`). It produces valid words.

## 6. What is Bag of Words (BoW) in NLP?
**Answer:**  
BoW is a simple method of text representation where each document is represented by word frequencies, ignoring word order.  
Example: `"I love NLP"` and `"NLP loves me"` → Both have similar words but different counts.

---

## 7. What is TF-IDF and how is it different from BoW?
**Answer:**  
TF-IDF (Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency) assigns higher weights to rare but important words. Unlike BoW, it reduces the impact of very frequent words (e.g., "the", "and").

---

## 8. What is word embedding?
**Answer:**  
Word embeddings are dense vector representations of words that capture semantic meaning. Examples: Word2Vec, GloVe, and FastText.

---

## 9. What is the difference between rule-based NLP and machine learning-based NLP?
**Answer:**  
- **Rule-based NLP:** Uses handcrafted linguistic rules. Example: regular expressions.  
- **ML-based NLP:** Learns from data using statistical or deep learning models. Example: sentiment analysis using neural networks.

## 10. What are some popular applications of NLP?
**Answer:**  
- Machine Translation (Google Translate)  
- Sentiment Analysis (Twitter, reviews)  
- Chatbots and Virtual Assistants (Siri, Alexa)  
- Text Summarization  
- Speech Recognition  
- Information Retrieval (search engines)
