# Research-Level Multimodal Evaluation & Interpretability Questions (Set 30)

## Q1. Why is interpretability harder in multimodal transformers than in unimodal LLMs?  
**A1.**  
- Multimodal transformers integrate heterogeneous embeddings (e.g., text, pixels, audio), making attention patterns complex.  
- Cross-modal layers create non-linear dependencies that obscure feature importance.  
- Visualization tools like Grad-CAM or attention rollout fail to generalize beyond the visual modality.  
- Emerging methods use **modality-specific saliency maps** and **cross-modal probing** to inspect latent interactions.

---

## Q2. How can we evaluate faithfulness of cross-modal explanations generated by multimodal LLMs?  
**A2.**  
- Faithfulness means that the textual explanation truly reflects the internal reasoning, not hallucination.  
- Standard metrics like BLEU or ROUGE don’t capture reasoning alignment.  
- Methods: **counterfactual evaluation** (perturbing image/audio and observing text change), **causal attribution** using attention gradients.  
- Research trend: multimodal “rationality consistency” benchmarks.

---

## Q3. What are the main evaluation challenges for vision-language models on multimodal reasoning tasks?  
**A3.**  
- Models often exploit dataset biases instead of reasoning (e.g., color correlations).  
- Metrics fail to assess reasoning steps — only correctness of the final answer.  
- Multi-step visual QA datasets like **GQA** or **VCR** attempt to test reasoning chains but remain imperfect.  
- Future direction: integrating **explanation consistency metrics** with task accuracy.

## Q4. How do scaling laws behave in multimodal models vs. text-only LLMs?  
**A4.**  
- Scaling laws for text LLMs are well-studied (loss ∝ model size⁻ᵅ).  
- Multimodal scaling is non-trivial due to **different data modalities** and **uneven scaling cost** (e.g., images are costlier to process).  
- Empirical findings show diminishing returns if one modality dominates.  
- Recent works suggest **balanced scaling** (equal FLOPs per modality) yields better cross-modal generalization.

---

## Q5. What’s the difference between “interpretability” and “grounding” in multimodal AI?  
**A5.**  
- **Interpretability:** human ability to trace internal representations or decisions.  
- **Grounding:** model’s ability to tie symbols or text to real-world sensory data.  
- They’re related but distinct — a grounded model might still be uninterpretable (e.g., it aligns correctly but we can’t trace how).  
- Modern research explores **joint grounded interpretability**, connecting both.

---

## Q6. Why is reproducibility a major issue in evaluating multimodal systems?  
**A6.**  
- Multimodal datasets are massive and often proprietary (e.g., LAION-5B).  
- Training pipelines include stochastic sampling, non-deterministic augmentations, and mixed precision arithmetic.  
- Even small seed changes lead to large performance variance.  
- Solution: open benchmarks, deterministic preprocessing pipelines, model cards with metadata.

---

## Q7. How can we perform interpretability for text-to-image diffusion models?  
**A7.**  
- Diffusion models work via iterative denoising; intermediate latents are difficult to interpret.  
- Methods:  
  - **Noise attribution** — track how textual tokens affect denoising steps.  
  - **Latent inversion** — map generated images back into latent space to identify responsible text tokens.  
- Limitations: interpretability vs. generation fidelity trade-off.

---

## Q8. Why do multimodal LLMs hallucinate in grounded tasks despite visual input?  
**A8.**  
- Cross-modal attention can overweight language priors.  
- Dataset bias (e.g., frequent caption patterns) leads to “language-driven” hallucination.  
- Mitigation: **contrastive grounding**, **visual attention regularization**, and **modality dropout** during training.  
- Example: model says “dog wearing a hat” when image has none — due to prior associations.

---

## Q9. What metrics can be used to evaluate temporal reasoning in video-language models?  
**A9.**  
- Need to assess sequence-level understanding, not just frame-by-frame accuracy.  
- Metrics:  
  - **Temporal Alignment Score (TAS)** for action order understanding.  
  - **Event Consistency (EC)** for narrative coherence.  
  - **Grounded Temporal Recall (GTR)** for multi-event correspondence.  
- Benchmark examples: **TVQA**, **HowTo100M**, **VidSitu**.

---

## Q10. How do interpretable proxies help researchers debug large multimodal models?  
**A10.**  
- Proxy models approximate complex systems but with interpretable architectures (e.g., sparse attention, low-rank factorization).  
- Allow controlled experiments on small-scale analogs.  
- Insight: helps reveal cross-modal alignment errors or biased attention heads.  
- Example: training a smaller “explainable” model to emulate CLIP-like alignment.
