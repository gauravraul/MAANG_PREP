# Set 45: Research-Level NLP — Scaling Laws, Efficiency, and Interpretability

---

### **Q1.** What are scaling laws in large language models (LLMs)?
**A1.** Scaling laws describe how **model performance (loss)** changes predictably with **model size, dataset size, and compute budget**.  
Empirically, loss decreases **log-linearly** with increasing parameters, data, and compute — up to a point of **data saturation**.  
These laws guide **efficient training** and **compute allocation** strategies.

---

### **Q2.** What is the “Chinchilla scaling law,” and how does it differ from GPT-3’s approach?
**A2.**  
- **GPT-3:** Over-parameterized relative to its training data.  
- **Chinchilla (DeepMind):** Showed that for a fixed compute budget, **smaller models trained on more data** outperform larger, under-trained ones.  
  → Optimal ratio ≈ 20 tokens per model parameter.  
This finding revolutionized how we **scale LLMs efficiently**.

---

### **Q3.** What are the key interpretability challenges in large language models?
**A3.**  
- **Opaque internal representations** (hard to trace reasoning).  
- **Feature entanglement** — multiple unrelated concepts share similar embeddings.  
- **Distributed knowledge storage** across neurons.  
- **Causal attribution** — difficulty mapping outputs to specific components or inputs.  
Interpretability is essential for **trust, debugging, and alignment**.

---

### **Q4.** How do researchers interpret LLMs using probing techniques?
**A4.**  
**Probing** involves training small classifiers (probes) on hidden representations to test for specific features like **syntax, sentiment, or world knowledge**.  
This helps reveal what information the model captures at different layers — e.g., syntactic structure in lower layers, semantics in higher layers.

---

### **Q5.** What are mechanistic interpretability techniques?
**A5.**  
Mechanistic interpretability attempts to **reverse-engineer** how models compute, at the circuit level.  
Techniques include:
- **Activation patching** (replace layer activations with others to isolate effects)  
- **Neuron-level analysis** (e.g., feature visualization)  
- **Attention pattern tracing**  
These methods aim to understand **causal circuits** inside models, not just correlations.

---

### **Q6.** Why is model alignment a harder problem than training accuracy?
**A6.**  
Training accuracy ensures the model outputs **statistically correct answers**, but alignment ensures it behaves in **human-intended, ethical, and context-aware ways**.  
LLMs may produce harmful, biased, or manipulative outputs even with high accuracy, so **alignment focuses on controllable value-driven behavior**.

---

### **Q7.** What are the main approaches to align large language models?
**A7.**
1. **Instruction tuning** — fine-tuning on task instructions and human-written completions.  
2. **RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback)** — optimizing responses via human preference scores.  
3. **RLAIF (Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback)** — using another AI as the feedback source.  
4. **Constitutional AI** — applying predefined ethical principles to guide model behavior.

---

### **Q8.** What is “representation collapse” in scaling and fine-tuning?
**A8.**  
Representation collapse happens when **features across tokens or layers become redundant**, reducing model expressiveness.  
It often occurs in over-regularized or over-fine-tuned models, leading to **loss of diversity in internal representations** and degraded generalization.

---

### **Q9.** How do efficiency techniques interact with scaling laws?
**A9.**  
Techniques like **mixture-of-experts (MoE)**, **quantization**, **sparse attention**, and **knowledge distillation** modify the relationship between compute and performance.  
While scaling laws hold for dense models, efficient architectures **deviate** by lowering compute without major performance trade-offs.

---

### **Q10.** What are open research directions in scaling and interpretability?
**A10.**  
- **Dynamic scaling** (adaptive model size during inference).  
- **Neural attribution maps** (understanding which neurons encode what).  
- **Scalable interpretability tools** for trillion-parameter models.  
- **Understanding emergent behaviors** — when and why capabilities suddenly appear.  
- **Aligning scaling with human values**, not just loss minimization.
