# Beginner NLP Questions and Answers (Set 2)

## 1. What is Tokenization in NLP?
**Answer:**  
Tokenization is the process of breaking text into smaller units called tokens, such as words, subwords, or sentences. For example, `"I love NLP"` → `["I", "love", "NLP"]`.

---

## 2. What is Stop Word Removal?
**Answer:**  
Stop word removal means filtering out common words (like "is", "the", "in") that do not carry significant meaning for tasks like search or classification. Example: `"The cat is on the mat"` → `["cat", "mat"]`.

---

## 3. What is Stemming?
**Answer:**  
Stemming is the process of reducing words to their root form by chopping off suffixes. Example: `"running"`, `"runs"` → `"run"`.

---

## 4. What is Lemmatization?
**Answer:**  
Lemmatization reduces words to their base or dictionary form (lemma), considering context. Example: `"better"` → `"good"` (using POS tagging).

---

## 5. What is Bag of Words (BoW)?
**Answer:**  
BoW is a text representation technique where a sentence/document is represented by the frequency of words in it, ignoring grammar and word order.

---

## 6. What is TF-IDF?
**Answer:**  
TF-IDF (Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency) is a statistical measure used to evaluate the importance of a word in a document relative to a collection of documents.

---

## 7. What is Named Entity Recognition (NER)?
**Answer:**  
NER is an NLP task that identifies and classifies entities in text into categories like names, places, dates, etc. Example: `"Barack Obama was born in Hawaii"` → `[Barack Obama: PERSON, Hawaii: LOCATION]`.

---

## 8. What is Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging?
**Answer:**  
POS tagging is assigning word types (noun, verb, adjective, etc.) to words in a sentence. Example: `"Dogs bark loudly"` → `Dogs (Noun), bark (Verb), loudly (Adverb)`.

---

## 9. What is Word Embedding?
**Answer:**  
Word embedding is a representation of words in a continuous vector space where similar words have similar vectors. Examples: **Word2Vec**, **GloVe**.

---

## 10. What is the difference between Rule-Based NLP and ML-Based NLP?
**Answer:**  
- **Rule-based NLP:** Uses hand-crafted linguistic rules (e.g., grammar-based chatbots).  
- **ML-based NLP:** Learns from data using models like Naive Bayes, RNNs, Transformers.
