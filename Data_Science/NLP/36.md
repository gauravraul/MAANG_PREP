# Research-Level NLP / Multimodal AI / Speech Questions (Set 24)

## Q1. What are emergent abilities in large language models (LLMs)?
**A1.** Emergent abilities are capabilities that were not explicitly programmed or present in smaller models but arise at scale. Examples include few-shot learning, in-context reasoning, and compositional generalization. These suggest non-linear scaling effects.

---

## Q2. How do scaling laws extend to multimodal AI?
**A2.** Multimodal scaling laws show that larger models trained on combined modalities (e.g., text + images) exhibit improved cross-modal alignment and zero-shot transfer. However, scaling costs increase exponentially due to higher input dimensionality.

---

## Q3. What are key challenges in aligning speech-language models?
**A3.** Challenges include:
- Preserving semantic fidelity during transcription/translation.  
- Avoiding bias from speech accent and demographic representation.  
- Handling temporal alignment between spoken input and textual/semantic output.  

---

## Q4. How does interpretability differ between text-only and multimodal models?
**A4.**  
- Text-only models: Feature attribution methods (saliency, attention weights).  
- Multimodal models: Cross-attention maps between modalities, probing representations for modality-specific vs. shared features.  
Interpretability is harder due to heterogeneous input types.

## Q5. What role does synthetic data play in speech and multimodal AI?
**A5.** Synthetic data augmentation improves robustness and reduces data scarcity:
- TTS (Text-to-Speech) for low-resource speech recognition.  
- Synthetic captions for vision-language models.  
- Style transfer for diverse accents.  
But risks include propagating errors and distribution shift.

---

## Q6. Explain the concept of “alignment tax” in large models.
**A6.** Alignment tax refers to the computational and data overhead required to align LLMs (or multimodal models) with human preferences and ethical standards. For instance, RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) requires large-scale annotation and fine-tuning.

---

## Q7. How can multimodal models address hallucination?
**A7.**  
- Cross-checking consistency between modalities (e.g., image-grounded QA).  
- Retrieval-augmented multimodal reasoning.  
- Training with negative samples that penalize misaligned modality outputs.  
These approaches reduce but don’t eliminate hallucination.

---

## Q8. Why is speech understanding harder than text processing?
**A8.**  
- Speech has variability (accents, background noise, speaking rates).  
- Temporal sequencing is continuous, unlike discrete tokens in text.  
- Requires both acoustic and linguistic modeling simultaneously.  

---

## Q9. How do researchers evaluate multimodal alignment?
**A9.**  
- CLIP-like similarity benchmarks.  
- Retrieval tasks (image-to-text, text-to-audio).  
- Zero-shot cross-modal transfer.  
- Human evaluation of semantic consistency across modalities.

---

## Q10. What future directions exist for NLP + multimodal + speech integration?
**A10.**  
- Unified foundation models combining text, vision, audio, and video.  
- Real-time multimodal agents (speech + vision + action).  
- Advances in causal interpretability to ensure safe alignment.  
- Efficient scaling methods to reduce compute costs.
