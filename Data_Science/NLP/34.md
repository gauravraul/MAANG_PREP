# Set 22 – Research-Level Multimodal AI (CV + NLP + Speech Integration)

## Category 1: Foundations of Multimodal Learning

**Q1. Why is multimodal alignment harder than unimodal alignment?**  
**A1.** Different modalities (text, image, audio) have heterogeneous structures and distributions. Aligning them requires learning a shared latent space where semantic meaning overlaps, despite differences in granularity, noise, and representation.

**Q2. Compare CLIP (contrastive learning) with Flamingo (generative multimodal). What are their tradeoffs?**  
**A2.**  
- **CLIP**: Contrastive, scalable, efficient; aligns vision-text via joint embeddings but cannot generate detailed descriptions.  
- **Flamingo**: Generative, supports few-shot multimodal reasoning; richer outputs but much more compute-heavy.

**Q3. How does modality collapse occur in multimodal training?**  
**A3.** One modality (often text) dominates learning while the other (e.g., vision) is underutilized. This leads to poor fusion and failure to exploit multimodal synergies.

## Category 2: Architectures

**Q4. What are cross-attention layers, and how do they differ from self-attention in multimodal models?**  
**A4.**  
- **Self-attention**: Computes dependencies within a modality (e.g., words in a sentence).  
- **Cross-attention**: Lets one modality (e.g., text) attend to another (e.g., vision embeddings), enabling fusion across modalities.

**Q5. How does BLIP-2 achieve efficient vision-language pretraining?**  
**A5.** BLIP-2 uses frozen pretrained encoders (e.g., ViT for images, LLM for text) and learns lightweight **Q-Former** layers to bridge modalities, reducing training cost while retaining strong performance.

**Q6. Why do large multimodal models often freeze pretrained encoders during fine-tuning?**  
**A6.** Freezing preserves pretrained knowledge, reduces compute cost, prevents catastrophic forgetting, and allows smaller adapters or cross-modal modules to specialize.

## Category 3: Advanced Training Strategies

**Q7. Explain curriculum learning in multimodal AI. How can it be applied?**  
**A7.** Train models first on easier tasks (captioning, retrieval) before harder ones (VQA, reasoning). This builds robust multimodal representations progressively.

**Q8. Why is multimodal pretraining data noisy, and how can this be mitigated?**  
**A8.** Web-scale data often has misaligned captions, irrelevant tags, or duplicate images. Mitigation: filtering with CLIP scores, using curated datasets, or applying data deduplication.

**Q9. What is modality dropout, and why is it useful in training?**  
**A9.** Randomly dropping one modality during training forces the model to learn redundancy and prevents over-reliance on a single modality. Improves robustness in missing-modality scenarios.

## Category 4: Applications & Challenges

**Q10. Why is Visual Question Answering (VQA) a difficult multimodal benchmark?**  
**A10.** Requires combining visual perception, natural language understanding, and reasoning. Challenges: dataset bias, compositional generalization, and robustness to adversarial phrasing.

**Q11. What are key challenges in grounding multimodal models (e.g., aligning text to specific image regions)?**  
**A11.** Ambiguity in natural language, object occlusions, and lack of precise alignment data make grounding difficult. Attention maps can be noisy and not fully interpretable.

**Q12. How do multimodal models handle temporal dependencies in video + text tasks?**  
**A12.** They use temporal transformers, recurrent modules, or 3D convolutions to capture motion and sequence order. Cross-attention aligns language with specific video frames.

## Category 5: Speech + Multimodal Integration

**Q13. How is speech incorporated into multimodal architectures differently from text?**  
**A13.** Speech requires acoustic encoders (wav2vec, HuBERT) to map waveforms into embeddings, which are then fused with vision/text. Unlike text, speech is continuous, noisy, and time-dependent.

**Q14. What’s the challenge in speech-image-text tri-modal systems?**  
**A14.** Aligning three modalities with different temporal/spatial granularities. For example, synchronizing speech with image objects and text semantics simultaneously.

**Q15. Compare ASR + NLP pipeline vs. end-to-end speech-text multimodal training.**  
**A15.**  
- **ASR + NLP pipeline**: Modular, interpretable, but error propagation occurs (ASR mistakes degrade downstream NLP).  
- **End-to-end**: More robust, but harder to train and requires large datasets.

## Category 6: Open-Ended Research Thinking

**Q16. How might we build multimodal foundation models that generalize beyond paired data?**  
**A16.** Approaches include self-supervised contrastive learning, weak supervision, cross-modal distillation, and using world knowledge priors to connect modalities indirectly.

**Q17. In safety-critical multimodal AI (e.g., autonomous vehicles), what failure modes are unique compared to text-only LLMs?**  
**A17.** Misinterpreting visual cues (e.g., stop signs), failing in low-light/weather conditions, or cross-modal confusion (e.g., misaligning driver speech with visual context). Stakes are higher due to physical-world consequences.

**Q18. What role could symbolic reasoning play in multimodal AI?**  
**A18.** Symbolic reasoning can complement deep multimodal representations by enforcing logical consistency, enabling explicit grounding, and reducing hallucination in reasoning-heavy tasks.

**Q19. What are ethical risks of multimodal generative AI?**  
**A19.** Deepfakes, misinformation (text + image/video), privacy violations, and biased representations across culture/gender/ethnicity.

**Q20. Do you think multimodal models should move towards **unified architectures** (one encoder for all) or **specialized modular ones**? Why?**  
**A20.** Unified models are elegant but often inefficient and struggle with modality-specific nuances. Modular architectures (e.g., frozen encoders + adapters) are more scalable, interpretable, and easier to upgrade. A hybrid may balance both.
