# Intermediate Computer Vision Questions & Answers (Set 4)

### 1. What is the difference between Generative and Discriminative models in computer vision?
**Answer:**  
- **Generative models** learn the joint probability distribution `P(X, Y)` and can generate new samples (e.g., GANs, VAEs).  
- **Discriminative models** learn the conditional probability `P(Y|X)` and focus on classification tasks (e.g., CNN classifiers).  
- In vision, GANs (generative) are used for image synthesis, while ResNet (discriminative) is used for recognition.

### 2. Explain how a Region Proposal Network (RPN) works in Faster R-CNN.
**Answer:**  
- RPN generates bounding box proposals (candidate object regions).  
- It uses anchors of different sizes/aspect ratios over a feature map.  
- Each anchor is classified as object vs. background.  
- RPN outputs both **objectness score** and **refined bounding box coordinates**.

### 3. What is an embedding in Computer Vision, and why is it useful?
**Answer:**  
- An **embedding** is a vector representation of an image or object in a lower-dimensional space.  
- It captures semantic similarity (e.g., similar faces have embeddings close in space).  
- Used in **face recognition, image retrieval, and clustering**.

### 4. Explain the difference between Semantic Segmentation and Instance Segmentation.
**Answer:**  
- **Semantic Segmentation:** Classifies each pixel into a category (e.g., all “cars” labeled as one class).  
- **Instance Segmentation:** Separates individual objects of the same class (e.g., car #1 vs car #2).  
- Example: **Mask R-CNN** performs instance segmentation.

### 5. What is Spatial Transformer Network (STN)?
**Answer:**  
- An STN is a differentiable module that allows a network to **learn spatial transformations** like rotation, scaling, and cropping.  
- Helps the model become **invariant to spatial distortions** in images.

### 6. Why are ResNet skip connections important?
**Answer:**  
- They solve the **vanishing gradient problem** by allowing gradients to flow through identity shortcuts.  
- Enable training of **very deep networks** (100+ layers).  
- Residual connections make optimization easier and improve accuracy.

---

### 7. Explain the concept of Image Style Transfer.
**Answer:**  
- Combines the **content** of one image with the **style** of another using CNN feature maps.  
- Uses a **content loss** (difference in deep features) and a **style loss** (Gram matrix of feature correlations).  
- Produces visually appealing artistic effects.

---

### 8. What is the difference between Optical Flow and Object Tracking?
**Answer:**  
- **Optical Flow:** Estimates motion vectors for each pixel between frames.  
- **Object Tracking:** Follows an object across frames (using bounding boxes or masks).  
- Optical flow can help tracking but tracking focuses on specific instances.

### 9. How does YOLO differ from Faster R-CNN in object detection?
**Answer:**  
- **YOLO (You Only Look Once):** Single-stage detector, predicts bounding boxes and classes in one forward pass → faster.  
- **Faster R-CNN:** Two-stage detector, generates proposals (RPN) then classifies them → more accurate but slower.  
- Tradeoff: YOLO = real-time, Faster R-CNN = higher precision.

### 10. What is Contrastive Learning in Computer Vision?
**Answer:**  
- A self-supervised method where the model learns by pulling **similar images closer** in embedding space and pushing **different ones apart**.  
- Example: SimCLR, MoCo.  
- Useful for **unsupervised feature learning** without labels.
