# Computer Vision Beginner Q&A (Set 3)

### 1. What is an image in computer vision?
**Answer:**  
An image is a 2D matrix of pixel values. Each pixel represents the intensity of light at a particular location.  
- In grayscale images: pixel values range from 0 (black) to 255 (white).  
- In RGB images: each pixel has 3 values (Red, Green, Blue).

---

### 2. What is the difference between grayscale and color images?
**Answer:**  
- **Grayscale:** Contains only intensity information (1 channel).  
- **Color (RGB):** Contains 3 channels (Red, Green, Blue), allowing representation of colors.

### 3. What is image thresholding?
**Answer:**  
Thresholding is a technique used to segment images by converting them into binary images.  
- Pixels above a threshold → set to 1 (white).  
- Pixels below a threshold → set to 0 (black).

### 4. What are filters in image processing?
**Answer:**  
Filters are matrices (kernels) applied to an image to extract specific features or modify the image.  
Examples:  
- **Blur filter:** smooths an image.  
- **Edge detection filter:** highlights boundaries.  

---

### 5. What is image convolution?
**Answer:**  
Convolution is the process of sliding a filter (kernel) over an image and computing the weighted sum of pixel values. It is widely used in feature extraction.

### 6. What is OpenCV?
**Answer:**  
OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is a popular open-source library in Python, C++, and Java used for computer vision tasks like image processing, face detection, object tracking, etc.

---

### 7. What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning in computer vision?
**Answer:**  
- **Supervised:** Uses labeled data (e.g., cat vs dog classification).  
- **Unsupervised:** Uses unlabeled data for clustering or segmentation (e.g., grouping pixels by color).  

---

### 8. What is edge detection in images?
**Answer:**  
Edge detection is a technique to identify object boundaries in images.  
Algorithms: **Sobel, Prewitt, Canny Edge Detector.**

---

### 9. What is data augmentation in computer vision?
**Answer:**  
Data augmentation artificially increases the size of training datasets by transforming existing images.  
Examples: rotation, flipping, cropping, zooming.

---

### 10. What is the difference between classification and detection in computer vision?
**Answer:**  
- **Classification:** Identifies what is in an image (e.g., "This is a cat").  
- **Detection:** Identifies what and where objects are in an image (e.g., "A cat at these coordinates").
