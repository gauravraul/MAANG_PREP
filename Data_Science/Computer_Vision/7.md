# Intermediate Computer Vision Q&A (Set 3)

### 1. What is Image Pyramiding and why is it used?
**Answer:**  
Image pyramiding involves creating multiple scaled versions of an image (down-sampling or up-sampling).  
- **Gaussian Pyramid:** Smooth and downsample image.  
- **Laplacian Pyramid:** Stores difference between levels.  
**Uses:** Multi-scale feature extraction, object detection at different scales, image compression.

### 2. How do Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) achieve translation invariance?
**Answer:**  
CNNs achieve translation invariance through:  
- **Convolution:** Shared weights detect patterns regardless of position.  
- **Pooling:** Max/average pooling reduces sensitivity to small shifts.  
- **Data Augmentation:** Helps CNN generalize to variations in position.

### 3. What is Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)?
**Answer:**  
HOG is a feature descriptor that captures edge orientations.  
Steps:  
1. Compute gradients.  
2. Divide image into small cells.  
3. Create histograms of gradient orientations.  
4. Normalize across blocks.  
**Use:** Widely used in pedestrian detection before deep learning.

### 4. Explain Optical Flow and its applications.
**Answer:**  
Optical flow estimates motion of objects between two consecutive frames by analyzing pixel intensity changes.  
- **Dense Optical Flow:** Flow for every pixel.  
- **Sparse Optical Flow:** Flow for selected keypoints.  
**Applications:** Video compression, motion tracking, gesture recognition.

### 5. What is Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) in Object Detection?
**Answer:**  
NMS is used to eliminate redundant bounding boxes.  
Steps:  
1. Sort boxes by confidence score.  
2. Select highest-scoring box.  
3. Remove overlapping boxes with high IoU.  
**Result:** Keeps only the most relevant bounding boxes.

### 6. How does a Region Proposal Network (RPN) work?
**Answer:**  
RPN generates candidate object regions for detection.  
- Slides small network over feature maps.  
- Predicts objectness score and bounding box coordinates (anchors).  
- Passes top proposals to object classifier.  
**Use:** Backbone of Faster R-CNN.

### 7. What is the difference between Semantic and Panoptic Segmentation?
**Answer:**  
- **Semantic Segmentation:** Labels each pixel with a class (e.g., car, road, tree).  
- **Instance Segmentation:** Separates objects of the same class (e.g., 2 different cars).  
- **Panoptic Segmentation:** Combines both semantic + instance segmentation.

---

### 8. Explain how Face Recognition works.
**Answer:**  
Steps:  
1. **Face Detection** (e.g., Haar cascades, MTCNN).  
2. **Feature Extraction** (embeddings from CNNs like FaceNet, ArcFace).  
3. **Comparison** using similarity metrics (cosine similarity, Euclidean distance).  
4. **Decision:** Threshold to determine identity.  

---

### 9. What is Attention Mechanism in Vision?
**Answer:**  
Attention allows the model to focus on important regions of an image.  
- **Spatial Attention:** Focus on regions in image.  
- **Channel Attention:** Focus on feature maps.  
**Examples:** Vision Transformers (ViTs), SE-Net.

---

### 10. How is Depth estimated from Stereo Vision?
**Answer:**  
Stereo vision uses two cameras placed apart to mimic human eyes.  
- Compute **disparity map** (difference in position of features between left and right images).  
- Apply **triangulation** to calculate depth.  
**Applications:** Robotics, AR/VR, autonomous driving.
