# Beginner Computer Vision Questions and Answers

### Q1: What is the difference between image classification and object detection?
**Answer:**  
- **Image classification** assigns a label to the entire image (e.g., "cat" or "dog").  
- **Object detection** identifies and localizes multiple objects in an image with bounding boxes (e.g., detect both "cat" and "dog" in the same picture).

### Q2: What is a convolution operation in CNNs?
**Answer:**  
A convolution operation applies a small filter (kernel) over an image to extract features like edges, textures, or patterns.  
Mathematically, it slides the filter over the image, performing element-wise multiplication and summing the results.

### Q3: Why is pooling used in CNNs?
**Answer:**  
Pooling reduces the spatial size of the feature maps:  
- **Max pooling** takes the maximum value in a region.  
- **Average pooling** takes the average.  
It helps reduce computation, prevents overfitting, and makes the model invariant to small translations.

### Q4: What are the differences between grayscale and RGB images?
**Answer:**  
- **Grayscale image**: Each pixel has one intensity value (0–255).  
- **RGB image**: Each pixel has three values (Red, Green, Blue channels), usually 0–255 each.

### Q5: What is data augmentation in Computer Vision?
**Answer:**  
Data augmentation artificially increases the size of a dataset by applying transformations like:  
- Rotation  
- Flipping  
- Scaling  
- Cropping  
- Adding noise  
It helps improve generalization and prevents overfitting.

### Q6: What is the role of OpenCV in Computer Vision?
**Answer:**  
OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) provides efficient tools and functions for:  
- Image processing (e.g., resizing, blurring, edge detection)  
- Video analysis  
- Face detection  
- Object tracking

### Q7: What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning in CV?
**Answer:**  
- **Supervised learning**: Uses labeled data (e.g., image of a dog → "dog").  
- **Unsupervised learning**: Uses unlabeled data, focuses on finding patterns or clusters (e.g., grouping similar images without labels).

---

### Q8: What is the purpose of edge detection in images?
**Answer:**  
Edge detection highlights the boundaries of objects by detecting sharp intensity changes.  
Examples: Sobel, Canny, and Prewitt edge detectors.

---

### Q9: What is transfer learning in Computer Vision?
**Answer:**  
Transfer learning uses a pre-trained model (like ResNet, VGG, MobileNet) trained on a large dataset (like ImageNet) and fine-tunes it for a new, smaller dataset.  
It saves training time and improves performance.

### Q10: What is the difference between CNN and Fully Connected Neural Networks?
**Answer:**  
- **CNN**: Uses convolution and pooling layers to extract spatial features, suitable for images.  
- **Fully Connected NN**: Every neuron connects to all others, not efficient for large image data.
