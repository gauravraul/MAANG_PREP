# Computer Vision Beginner Questions & Answers

## Q1. What is Computer Vision?
**A:**  
Computer Vision is a field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that enables computers to interpret and process visual data (images and videos) from the real world, similar to how humans use vision.

## Q2. What is the difference between Computer Vision and Image Processing?
**A:**  
- **Image Processing** focuses on enhancing or transforming images (e.g., noise removal, resizing, filtering).  
- **Computer Vision** focuses on understanding and extracting meaningful information from images (e.g., object detection, face recognition).

## Q3. What are pixels in an image?
**A:**  
A pixel (short for *picture element*) is the smallest unit of an image. Each pixel contains color information, usually represented in RGB (Red, Green, Blue) values.

---

## Q4. What is the difference between grayscale and RGB images?
**A:**  
- **Grayscale Image:** Contains only intensity values (0â€“255), representing shades of gray.  
- **RGB Image:** Each pixel is represented by three values (Red, Green, Blue), allowing for millions of possible colors.

## Q5. What is Convolution in Computer Vision?
**A:**  
Convolution is a mathematical operation where a filter (kernel) is applied to an image to extract features like edges, textures, or patterns. It is a core concept in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

## Q6. What is the difference between classification and detection?
**A:**  
- **Classification:** Predicts a single label for the entire image (e.g., "cat" or "dog").  
- **Detection:** Identifies objects in an image and provides bounding boxes around them (e.g., detecting multiple cats and dogs in the same image).

## Q7. What is overfitting in Computer Vision models?
**A:**  
Overfitting happens when a model learns patterns specific to the training data but fails to generalize to new, unseen data. This leads to high training accuracy but poor test accuracy.

---

## Q8. What is the role of pooling in CNNs?
**A:**  
Pooling reduces the spatial dimensions of feature maps while retaining important information.  
- **Max Pooling:** Keeps the maximum value in a region.  
- **Average Pooling:** Takes the average value in a region.  
This helps reduce computation and prevents overfitting.

## Q9. What are some common applications of Computer Vision?
**A:**  
- Face Recognition  
- Autonomous Vehicles  
- Medical Imaging (e.g., tumor detection)  
- Surveillance Systems  
- Augmented Reality

## Q10. What is OpenCV?
**A:**  
OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is a popular open-source library for computer vision tasks. It provides tools for image processing, object detection, facial recognition, and more.
