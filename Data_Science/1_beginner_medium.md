## 4. Explain the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning.
**Answer:**  
- **Supervised Learning:** Uses labeled data to train models (e.g., classification, regression).  
- **Unsupervised Learning:** Works with unlabeled data to find hidden patterns (e.g., clustering, dimensionality reduction).

## 5. What is the role of statistics in Data Science?
**Answer:**  
Statistics helps in understanding data distributions, identifying patterns, testing hypotheses, and building predictive models in Data Science.

---

## 6. What is feature engineering and why is it important?
**Answer:**  
Feature engineering is the process of selecting, modifying, or creating new features from raw data to improve model performance. It plays a crucial role in enhancing predictive power.

---

## 7. What are the key differences between Python and R for Data Science?
**Answer:**  
- **Python:** General-purpose, great for ML, scalable, widely used in production.  
- **R:** Built for statistical analysis and visualization, preferred in academic settings.

## 8. What is the purpose of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)?
**Answer:**  
EDA involves summarizing the main characteristics of data using visual and quantitative techniques to understand data patterns, spot anomalies, and guide further analysis.

---

## 9. What is the difference between correlation and causation?
**Answer:**  
- **Correlation:** Measures how two variables move together.  
- **Causation:** Indicates that one variable directly affects another. Correlation does not imply causation.

---

## 10. What challenges do Data Scientists commonly face?
**Answer:**  
- Handling messy and incomplete data  
- Lack of clear business objectives  
- Communicating insights to non-technical stakeholders  
- Scaling models to production  
- Keeping up with rapidly evolving tools and techniques
