Derive the gradient of the logistic regression loss function.

> Include the sigmoid and binary cross-entropy function.



Why is softmax + cross-entropy used in multi-class classification?

> Go into derivative simplifications and numerical stability.



What happens if your loss function has multiple local minima?

> Discuss convexity, saddle points, gradient descent variants.
