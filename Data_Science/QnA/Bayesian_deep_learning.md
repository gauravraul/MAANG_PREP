# 10 Critical Thinking Questions and Answers on Bayesian Deep Learning

---

## 1. What is Bayesian Deep Learning, and how does it extend classical deep learning?

**Answer:**  
Bayesian Deep Learning incorporates **probabilistic modeling** into deep neural networks to **quantify uncertainty**.  
Instead of learning point estimates for weights, it learns **distributions over weights**, allowing the model to express **epistemic uncertainty**.  
This improves robustness, especially in safety-critical and data-sparse settings.

---

## 2. Why is modeling uncertainty important in deep learning applications?

**Answer:**  
Most standard neural networks are **overconfident**, even on:
- Out-of-distribution (OOD) data
- Noisy or adversarial inputs  
Bayesian approaches help:
- Detect when the model is unsure
- Avoid high-risk decisions in uncertain conditions (e.g., in medicine, autonomous driving)

---

## 3. What are the two main types of uncertainty in Bayesian Deep Learning?

**Answer:**  
1. **Epistemic Uncertainty** (model uncertainty):  
   - Arises from lack of knowledge or limited data  
   - Can be reduced with more data  
2. **Aleatoric Uncertainty** (data uncertainty):  
   - Inherent noise in data (e.g., sensor noise)  
   - Cannot be eliminated by more data

Bayesian models often aim to capture both.

## 4. Why is exact Bayesian inference in deep networks intractable?

**Answer:**  
Deep neural networks have **millions of parameters** and **nonlinear, high-dimensional likelihoods**, making:
- The posterior over weights complex and multi-modal
- Closed-form computation of posteriors impossible

This necessitates **approximate inference** methods like:
- Variational inference
- Monte Carlo methods

---

## 5. What is variational inference and how is it used in Bayesian neural networks?

**Answer:**  
Variational inference approximates the true posterior \( p(w|D) \) with a simpler distribution \( q(w|\theta) \), by minimizing the **KL divergence** between them.  
In practice:
- The network is trained to optimize ELBO (Evidence Lower Bound)
- Parameters of \( q(w) \) are learned instead of fixed weights

This makes Bayesian training scalable to large models.

---

## 6. What is Monte Carlo Dropout, and how does it approximate Bayesian inference?

**Answer:**  
Monte Carlo (MC) Dropout:
- Applies dropout during both training **and** inference
- Performs **multiple stochastic forward passes**
- Aggregates predictions to approximate uncertainty

Gal & Ghahramani (2016) showed dropout behaves like a variational approximation to a Bayesian model.

---

## 7. How can you evaluate uncertainty estimates in Bayesian Deep Learning?

**Answer:**  
Good uncertainty models should:
- Assign **low confidence to OOD or ambiguous inputs**
- Have **well-calibrated predictive distributions**
- Improve **decision-making under uncertainty**

Evaluation techniques include:
- Calibration plots (e.g., reliability diagrams)
- Predictive entropy
- Negative log-likelihood (NLL)
- Proper scoring rules (e.g., Brier score)

---

## 8. What are Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs), and how do they compare to standard NNs?

**Answer:**  
BNNs maintain **distributions over weights** rather than point estimates.  
Pros:
- Can capture uncertainty
- More robust to overfitting  
Cons:
- Computationally intensive
- Harder to train and scale

They're useful where **confidence in predictions matters more than raw accuracy**.

---

## 9. In what scenarios does Bayesian Deep Learning provide the most value?

**Answer:**  
Best suited for:
- **Low-data regimes** (few-shot, medical imaging)
- **Safety-critical applications** (autonomous driving, finance, healthcare)
- **Scientific modeling** (with prior knowledge)
- **Active learning** (selecting informative samples)

Bayesian DL provides **uncertainty-aware generalization** in such contexts.

---

## 10. How does Bayesian Deep Learning enable active learning?

**Answer:**  
Active learning selects the most **informative data points** to label.  
Bayesian models use **uncertainty estimates** to:
- Choose data with high epistemic uncertainty
- Maximize expected model improvement  
This reduces labeling cost and improves learning efficiency â€” especially useful in domains with **expensive annotations**.
