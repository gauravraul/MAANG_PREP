# Advanced Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) – 10 Toughest Questions and Answers

## 1. Why do deep neural networks suffer from vanishing or exploding gradients, and how is it mitigated?
**Answer:**  
In deep networks, gradients can:
- **Shrink exponentially** (vanishing) or
- **Grow uncontrollably** (exploding)  
during backpropagation through layers.  
**Mitigation**:
- Use **ReLU** instead of sigmoid/tanh
- Apply **batch normalization**
- Use **residual connections** (ResNet)
- Proper **weight initialization** (Xavier, He)

## 2. How does the Universal Approximation Theorem relate to ANN capabilities?
**Answer:**  
It states that a **single hidden layer** neural network with enough neurons can approximate **any continuous function** on a compact domain.  
**Limitations**:
- It doesn’t guarantee efficient learning or good generalization
- Doesn’t specify **how many neurons** or **how to train**

## 3. How do you choose the number of hidden layers and neurons in an ANN?
**Answer:**  
There's no one-size-fits-all. General approach:
- Start simple and use **cross-validation**
- For structured data: 1–2 hidden layers often suffice
- For unstructured data (e.g. images, text): deeper networks preferred
- Use techniques like **Bayesian Optimization**, **grid/random search**, or **neural architecture search (NAS)**

## 4. What is overfitting in ANNs and how can it be prevented?
**Answer:**  
Overfitting occurs when the network learns noise or patterns specific to training data.  
**Prevention**:
- **Dropout**
- **Early stopping**
- **L1/L2 regularization**
- **Data augmentation**
- **More training data**
- Use **simpler architecture**

## 5. Explain the role of activation functions and why ReLU is preferred over sigmoid/tanh.
**Answer:**  
Activation functions introduce **non-linearity**.  
- **Sigmoid/tanh**: Suffer from vanishing gradients; slow training
- **ReLU**: Sparse activation, mitigates vanishing gradients, faster convergence  
Variants like **Leaky ReLU**, **ELU**, **GELU** address ReLU’s zero-gradient problem for negative inputs.

## 6. Why is backpropagation combined with gradient descent, and how does it work?
**Answer:**  
**Backpropagation** efficiently computes gradients of the loss with respect to each parameter using the chain rule.  
These gradients are then used in **gradient descent** to update weights.  
It's essential for training large networks efficiently.

## 7. What are the challenges of training deep neural networks?
**Answer:**  
Challenges include:
- **Vanishing/exploding gradients**
- **Overfitting**
- **Long training times**
- **Poor initialization**
- **Local minima and saddle points**
Solutions involve better optimizers (Adam), architectures (ResNet), and techniques (BN, Dropout).

---

## 8. How do weight initialization strategies affect training in ANNs?
**Answer:**  
Improper initialization can:
- Cause gradients to vanish or explode
- Slow down or prevent convergence  
Strategies:
- **Xavier (Glorot)**: Good for tanh
- **He initialization**: Better for ReLU  
These methods help preserve variance across layers.

---

## 9. Explain the bias-variance tradeoff in the context of neural networks.
**Answer:**  
- **High bias**: Underfitting – model too simple to capture patterns  
- **High variance**: Overfitting – model too sensitive to training data  
Neural networks can easily **overfit** due to high capacity. Use regularization and proper validation to balance both.

## 10. What is the role of batch normalization in ANN training?
**Answer:**  
Batch normalization:
- Normalizes inputs within each mini-batch
- Reduces **internal covariate shift**
- Allows **higher learning rates**
- Acts as a **regularizer**  
Leads to **faster convergence** and **better generalization**, especially in deep networks.
