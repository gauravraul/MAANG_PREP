# Challenges and Limitations in Fine-Tuning LLMs – Q&A

## Q1. Why is fine-tuning LLMs resource-intensive?

**A1.**  
Fine-tuning full LLMs (e.g., GPT, LLaMA) requires:
- **High-end GPUs or TPUs** with large VRAM (e.g., A100 80GB)
- **Significant memory** for optimizer states, gradients, and activation caching
- **Long training times** even with powerful infrastructure
- Expensive compute budgets, especially when fine-tuning on large datasets

---

## Q2. How does catastrophic forgetting affect fine-tuned LLMs?

**A2.**  
Fine-tuning on a narrow dataset can overwrite the model’s pre-trained general knowledge, leading to:
- Loss of fluency or factuality on general tasks
- Reduced performance outside the fine-tuned domain
- Overfitting to training distribution, hurting robustness

---

## Q3. What are the risks of overfitting during fine-tuning?

**A3.**  
- Model memorizes dataset quirks or user-specific artifacts  
- Poor generalization to unseen data  
- Factual errors or biased outputs due to narrow training scope  
- Especially dangerous in instruction tuning or alignment tasks

---

## Q4. Why is data quality a critical bottleneck in fine-tuning?

**A4.**  
- LLMs are sensitive to subtle biases, formatting errors, and hallucinations in training data  
- Noisy or poorly curated data can degrade performance  
- Synthetic or user-generated data often lacks sufficient diversity or correctness  
- Data labeling is expensive and often inconsistent

---

## Q5. What are the operational challenges in maintaining fine-tuned models?

**A5.**  
- Every fine-tuned model version needs **versioning, CI/CD, and rollback capabilities**  
- Larger storage and infra for model artifacts and training logs  
- DevOps effort for **monitoring drift** and retraining pipelines  
- Deployment becomes complex due to compatibility and latency tradeoffs

---

## Q6. How does fine-tuning reduce flexibility compared to RAG?

**A6.**  
- New knowledge requires re-finetuning → slow and costly  
- Cannot update knowledge on-the-fly like RAG  
- No real-time grounding in documents → risk of outdated or stale responses  
- Less explainable: harder to trace generated output back to data sources

---

## Q7. What is the challenge of hyperparameter tuning in fine-tuning?

**A7.**  
- Requires grid or Bayesian search over:
  - Learning rates
  - Batch size
  - Epochs
  - Warmup steps  
- No single recipe works across domains or model sizes  
- Minor changes can significantly impact model performance or stability

---

## Q8. Why is fine-tuning challenging across languages or modalities?

**A8.**  
- Non-English corpora may lack scale and diversity  
- Tokenization mismatch or low vocabulary coverage  
- Multimodal fine-tuning (e.g., image-text) requires complex data pipelines and loss engineering  
- Biases in pretraining may persist or amplify

---

## Q9. What are the licensing and compliance limitations with fine-tuning?

**A9.**  
- Many open models (e.g., LLaMA, Mistral) restrict commercial usage or redistribution  
- Fine-tuned models may violate data privacy if trained on sensitive or PII-rich datasets  
- Hard to audit and explain behavior in regulated industries (e.g., finance, healthcare)

---

## Q10. Can fine-tuning introduce or amplify harmful behaviors?

**A10.**  
Yes.
- Misaligned prompts or adversarial data can introduce:
  - Toxicity
  - Hallucinations
  - Misuse behaviors  
- No guarantee of safety or value alignment unless fine-tuned with RLHF or constitutional AI strategies

---

## Q11. What are the challenges with evaluation and benchmarking?

**A11.**  
- No universal metric; BLEU/ROUGE don’t reflect factual accuracy or alignment  
- Human evals are costly and inconsistent  
- Task-specific performance may improve, but general capabilities can regress  
- Benchmarks (e.g., HELM, BIG-Bench) often lag real-world use cases

---

## Q12. Why does full fine-tuning become impractical for model updates?

**A12.**  
- With continuous data inflow, full fine-tuning is not scalable  
- Frequent retraining wastes compute and time  
- Parameter-efficient techniques (like LoRA, QLoRA, adapters) are better suited for fast iteration

---

## Q13. What are the security and privacy risks in fine-tuning?

**A13.**  
- Fine-tuning on user data can leak sensitive information via model inversion or probing attacks  
- Adversarial fine-tuning (model poisoning) is a real threat in open pipelines  
- Requires differential privacy or data sanitization practices to mitigate

---

## Q14. How do deployment constraints differ after fine-tuning?

**A14.**  
- Fine-tuned models may:
  - Consume more memory
  - Require different quantization approaches
  - Be less optimized for inference-time efficiency  
- Incompatibility with hardware accelerators or model serving stacks

---

## Q15. What makes debugging fine-tuned models harder?

**A15.**  
- Lack of visibility into learned representations or parameter changes  
- Fine-tuning alters internal attention patterns unpredictably  
- Requires interpretability tools (e.g., attention maps, probing classifiers) that are still evolving  
- Behavioral regression can be subtle and non-deterministic

---

## Q16. What is the challenge of domain-specific fine-tuning?

**A16.**  
- Requires deep domain expertise for data curation  
- General LLMs often underperform on specialized jargon or logical reasoning  
- Data scarcity is common in enterprise or scientific domains  
- May require instruction tuning, prompting strategies, and architectural tweaks (e.g., longer context)

---

## Q17. Is fine-tuning worth it compared to prompt engineering or adapters?

**A17.**  
Not always.
- For small updates or alignment tasks, **PEFT** (Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning) techniques like LoRA, BitFit, or adapters are cheaper and faster  
- Prompt engineering with high-quality templates can outperform poor fine-tuning  
- Fine-tuning shines when:
  - Instruction-following is poor
  - Latency needs to be low (no RAG or multi-step chains)
  - You own the model lifecycle completely
