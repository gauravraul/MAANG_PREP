# Beginner Applied Mathematics for Data Science – Question & Answer #3

---

## Q: Why are mean, median, and mode important in data science, and how do they help in understanding datasets?

---

### Answer:

Mean, median, and mode are part of **descriptive statistics**, which help summarize and understand large datasets quickly. These are called **measures of central tendency**, and they give insight into what is "typical" or "central" in the data.

They are often the **first tools** a data scientist uses when analyzing a dataset.

---

### Practical Understanding and Applications:

#### 1. **Mean (Average)**
- It tells you the **overall trend** of the data.
- Used heavily in algorithms like **linear regression**.
- But it can be **sensitive to outliers**.

**Example**:  
If most people in a city earn ₹50K, but a few earn ₹10 crores, the **mean salary** will appear much higher than what most people actually earn.

---

#### 2. **Median (Middle Value)**
- This is the **middle point** when data is sorted.
- **Robust to outliers** — great when data is skewed.
- Commonly used in **income distributions**, **house prices**, etc.

**Example**:  
In housing markets, the **median home price** is a better representation of a typical home than the average, which can be inflated by a few luxury houses.

---

#### 3. **Mode (Most Frequent Value)**
- Represents the **most common** value.
- Useful for **categorical data** (like favorite ice cream flavor).
- Helps detect **dominant patterns** in customer behavior or product preferences.

**Example**:  
If a retail website wants to restock items, it can look at the **mode** of product purchases to find the most bought item.

---

### Why These Matter in Data Science:

- They help in **profiling your data** before building models.
- They can reveal **data quality issues** or **biases**.
- Help determine **normal vs. abnormal behavior** (outlier detection).
- Used in **data imputation** (filling missing values).

---

### Practical Tip:
Use **mean** when data is evenly distributed,  
**median** when data is skewed or has outliers,  
**mode** when dealing with categorical or frequent values.

Together, these give a **well-rounded understanding** of any dataset before diving into more complex modeling.
