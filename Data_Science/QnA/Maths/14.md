### Q7: What is the significance of the Jacobian matrix in data science, particularly in transformation of variables?

**Answer:**
The Jacobian matrix is crucial when performing transformations in multivariable calculus, especially when switching from one coordinate system to another (e.g., from Cartesian to polar).  
In data science, it is often used in:

- **Feature transformations** in machine learning where features are nonlinear functions of others.
- **Change of variables in probability distributions**: For example, when transforming random variables, the probability density function must be adjusted using the determinant of the Jacobian.
- **Optimization problems**: Many gradient-based optimization methods use Jacobians to understand how outputs change with respect to multiple inputs.
- **Computer vision**: Mapping pixel coordinates after transformations like rotation or warping involves Jacobians.

The determinant of the Jacobian measures how much a small region in the input space is stretched or compressed in the transformation. This is critical in ensuring probability mass is preserved correctly in transformed distributions.
