### Q11: How does the concept of Lagrange multipliers help in constrained optimization problems in data science?

**Answer:**
Lagrange multipliers provide a method for finding the extrema (minimum or maximum) of a function subject to one or more equality constraints.

If we want to maximize or minimize \( f(x, y, \dots) \) subject to a constraint \( g(x, y, \dots) = 0 \), we define the **Lagrangian**:

\[
\mathcal{L}(x, y, \lambda) = f(x, y) + \lambda \cdot g(x, y)
\]

**How it helps in data science:**
- **Support Vector Machines (SVMs):** Lagrange multipliers are used in the dual formulation of the optimization problem, making it easier to apply the kernel trick.
- **Portfolio optimization:** Helps find the optimal allocation of assets while satisfying budget or risk constraints.
- **Maximum likelihood estimation with constraints:** Used when parameters must satisfy specific relationships.
- **Neural networks with weight constraints:** For example, ensuring weights sum to a fixed value.

The beauty of this method is that it transforms a constrained optimization problem into an unconstrained one by incorporating the constraint into the objective function via the multiplier \( \lambda \).
