# Intermediate Applied Mathematics for Data Science – Q&A

## Question 1: What is the Jacobian matrix, and how is it used in machine learning?

**Answer**:  
The Jacobian matrix is a matrix of all first-order partial derivatives of a vector-valued function. In machine learning, particularly in deep learning and neural networks, the Jacobian is crucial for understanding how outputs change with respect to inputs. It plays a key role in:

- Backpropagation (especially in custom loss layers).
- Sensitivity analysis.
- Gradient-based optimization.
- Adversarial attacks and explainability (e.g., saliency maps).

## Question 2: Why is understanding eigenvectors and eigenvalues important in data science?

**Answer**:  
Eigenvectors and eigenvalues help identify directions of maximum variance in data (e.g., in PCA). Applications include:

- Dimensionality reduction.
- Understanding covariance structures.
- Graph-based algorithms (e.g., spectral clustering, PageRank).
- Stability analysis in optimization.

## Question 3: How does the concept of convexity apply to machine learning?

**Answer**:  
A convex function has a single global minimum, making it ideal for optimization. Many loss functions (e.g., mean squared error, logistic loss) are convex, ensuring that gradient descent converges reliably. In non-convex settings (like deep neural networks), convex approximations or relaxations may be used during analysis or model simplification.

## Question 4: Explain the importance of the Taylor series in gradient-based optimization.

**Answer**:  
The Taylor series helps approximate a function locally using derivatives. In optimization, especially gradient descent, the first-order Taylor expansion approximates how the loss changes with small parameter updates. It forms the basis of methods like:

- Line search.
- Newton’s method (via second-order Taylor expansion).

## Question 5: What is the difference between L1 and L2 regularization from a geometric perspective?

**Answer**:  
- **L1 (Lasso)**: Adds an absolute value penalty. It results in sparse solutions (driving weights to zero), ideal for feature selection.
- **L2 (Ridge)**: Adds a squared penalty. It shrinks weights smoothly but rarely eliminates them, improving generalization.

From a geometric perspective, L1 forms a diamond constraint region, encouraging sparsity, while L2 forms a circle, leading to smoother solutions.

## Question 6: How does matrix factorization relate to recommendation systems?

**Answer**:  
Matrix factorization techniques (like SVD or ALS) decompose the user-item interaction matrix into low-dimensional user and item embeddings. These latent factors help:

- Predict missing values.
- Capture underlying user preferences and item features.
- Improve scalability in collaborative filtering.

## Question 7: What is the role of the law of total probability in Bayesian inference?

**Answer**:  
It allows marginalizing over latent variables to compute the total probability of an event. In Bayesian inference, it's used to:

- Normalize posterior distributions.
- Integrate out nuisance variables.
- Enable probabilistic reasoning in hierarchical models.

---

## Question 8: How does multicollinearity affect regression models?

**Answer**:  
Multicollinearity arises when independent variables are highly correlated. It causes:

- Instability in coefficient estimates.
- Inflated standard errors.
- Poor generalization.

Solutions include PCA, L2 regularization, or removing correlated features.

## Question 9: Explain how the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) is applied in A/B testing.

**Answer**:  
CLT states that the distribution of sample means approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases, regardless of the underlying distribution. In A/B testing, it allows us to:

- Construct confidence intervals.
- Perform hypothesis testing on sample averages.
- Estimate population metrics with known uncertainty.

---

## Question 10: What is the significance of stochastic processes in time series forecasting?

**Answer**:  
Stochastic processes model sequences of random variables evolving over time. In time series:

- ARIMA models assume specific stochastic processes.
- They help capture randomness and dependencies.
- Essential in forecasting, anomaly detection, and signal modeling.
