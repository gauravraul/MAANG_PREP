# Introduction to Data Science - Day 2: Medium Questions and Answers

## 1. What is the difference between qualitative and quantitative data?
**Answer:**  
- **Qualitative data** describes categories or qualities (e.g., colors, gender, labels).  
- **Quantitative data** is numerical and can be measured (e.g., height, age, income).

## 2. What is data wrangling?
**Answer:**  
Data wrangling (or munging) is the process of cleaning, restructuring, and enriching raw data into a desired format for better analysis.

## 3. What is a data pipeline?
**Answer:**  
A data pipeline is a series of processes that automate the collection, transformation, and loading (ETL) of data from source to destination systems.

## 4. What does “scalability” mean in Data Science?
**Answer:**  
Scalability refers to a model or system's ability to handle increased data volume, complexity, or user demand without performance degradation.

## 5. How is data stored in NoSQL databases different from SQL databases?
**Answer:**  
- **SQL databases** store data in tables with rows and columns (structured).  
- **NoSQL databases** store unstructured or semi-structured data in formats like key-value, document, or graph models.

## 6. What is the role of a data engineer vs. a data scientist?
**Answer:**  
- **Data Engineer:** Builds and maintains data infrastructure and pipelines.  
- **Data Scientist:** Analyzes data and builds models to extract insights or predictions.

## 7. What is a data lake?
**Answer:**  
A data lake is a storage system that holds large volumes of raw data in its native format, including structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data.

## 8. What does “garbage in, garbage out” mean in Data Science?
**Answer:**  
It means poor quality input data leads to poor analysis or model results. Clean, relevant data is crucial for accurate outcomes.

## 9. What is data normalization?
**Answer:**  
Data normalization is the process of scaling numerical features to a common scale (e.g., 0 to 1) to ensure equal weight in model training.

## 10. What’s the difference between a CSV and a JSON file in data storage?
**Answer:**  
- **CSV (Comma-Separated Values):** Stores tabular data as plain text.  
- **JSON (JavaScript Object Notation):** Stores structured data as key-value pairs, suitable for nested or hierarchical data.
