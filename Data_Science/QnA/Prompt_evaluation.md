# Prompt Evaluation: 10 Critical Thinking Questions & Answers

These questions are designed to evaluate deep hands-on experience with prompt engineering and its evaluation in LLM systems.

## 1. How do you define and measure the effectiveness of a prompt?

**Answer:**  
Effectiveness can be measured using a combination of:
- **Task accuracy** (e.g., BLEU, ROUGE, EM)
- **User satisfaction** (via qualitative evaluation)
- **Latency & token efficiency**
- **Robustness** across variations in input
Additionally, feedback loops using reinforcement learning or human-in-the-loop (HITL) methods help assess and refine prompt quality.

## 2. What is prompt drift, and how do you detect it?

**Answer:**  
Prompt drift refers to degradation in model performance due to subtle changes in the prompt or context. It can be detected by:
- Regression testing across prompt versions
- Monitoring output consistency with a reference set
- Use of prompt versioning systems (e.g., LangChain or PromptLayer) to compare output deltas

---

## 3. How do you test the generalizability of a prompt?

**Answer:**  
To test generalizability:
- Apply the prompt on **unseen or edge-case inputs**
- Use **cross-domain datasets**
- Perform **A/B testing** on multiple task variations
- Track **accuracy variance** across different data distributions

---

## 4. What metrics would you use to evaluate prompt quality for a classification task?

**Answer:**  
- **Accuracy**, **Precision**, **Recall**, **F1-score**
- **Calibration error** if probabilities are used
- **Confusion Matrix** to spot class confusion trends
- **Latency** and **token cost per inference**
- **Prompt sensitivity tests**: e.g., small rewording impact

---

## 5. How do you evaluate multi-turn prompt chains (e.g., in an Agent or chatbot)?

**Answer:**  
- Evaluate each prompt step using intermediate expectations
- End-to-end task success rate
- Chain-of-thought alignment: did steps logically follow?
- Token usage tracking per step
- Failure mode attribution: which prompt step broke?

---

## 6. What are prompt evaluation techniques for factual QA systems?

**Answer:**  
- **Faithfulness** (Does output align with given or retrieved context?)
- **Factual accuracy** (Checked via ground-truth or using LLM-as-judge)
- Use of **attribution tools** (e.g., RAGAS, TruLens)
- Hallucination detection tools (like PromptInject or GPT-fact-checkers)

---

## 7. How do you assess prompt robustness?

**Answer:**  
By testing against:
- **Adversarial inputs** (e.g., typos, negations, misleading phrases)
- **Prompt paraphrases**
- **Synonym replacements** in critical prompt sections
- **Few-shot example order shuffling**

Prompt robustness = stable, accurate outputs under small perturbations.

---

## 8. How can you automate prompt evaluation at scale?

**Answer:**  
- Use LLM-based eval prompts (e.g., “Was the output correct and grounded?”)
- Integrate with **LangSmith**, **TruLens**, or **Promptfoo**
- Run **unit tests** across prompt variants
- Apply synthetic data generation to test multiple edge cases

---

## 9. What is prompt overfitting, and how do you detect it?

**Answer:**  
Prompt overfitting = good performance on known/test examples, poor on unseen cases.

Detection:
- Drop in performance on **out-of-distribution inputs**
- High variance between similar prompts
- Prompt performs well only on few-shot examples it was trained on

---

## 10. How would you compare multiple prompts for the same task?

**Answer:**  
- Create a shared benchmark dataset
- Evaluate:
  - Accuracy
  - Relevance
  - Token cost
  - Latency
- Use human raters or LLM-as-a-judge to rank outputs
- Apply **multi-metric comparison dashboards** (e.g., LangSmith)
