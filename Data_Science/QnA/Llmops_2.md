# Advanced LLMOps Questions and Answers

## 1. How do you design an architecture for serving multiple LLMs (e.g., GPT, LLaMA, Mixtral) at scale?

**Answer:**
Design a modular architecture using:
- **Model Gateway:** Routes requests based on model, latency, or tenant.
- **Model Registry:** Tracks available models and their metadata (version, tokenizer, quantization).
- **Model Serving Layer:** Use Triton Inference Server or vLLM for GPU-efficient loading.
- **Autoscaling with Queuing:** Use Kubernetes with KEDA + Redis queues for load management.
- **Multi-GPU Scheduling:** Use TensorRT or DeepSpeed for sharded inference.

## 2. What are the best practices for fine-tuning LLMs in production pipelines?

**Answer:**
- **Use LoRA or QLoRA:** Avoid full fine-tuning; update only adapter weights.
- **Track metadata:** Log dataset versions, hyperparameters, and eval metrics using tools like MLflow.
- **Offline Evaluation:** Run thorough evals on benchmarks and custom task-specific datasets before deployment.
- **Shadow Deployment:** Test the model in production without serving results to end users.

## 3. How do you manage and monitor prompt drift in production LLM applications?

**Answer:**
- **Log Prompts and Responses:** Use vector-based prompt similarity (e.g., cosine distance) to detect semantic drift.
- **Prompt Fingerprinting:** Hash canonical prompts to monitor variations over time.
- **Alerting:** Set thresholds for outlier prompts (e.g., too long, unexpected language).
- **Retraining Trigger:** Schedule prompt re-evaluation pipelines if drift exceeds baseline.

## 4. How can you optimize token throughput for multi-user inference?

**Answer:**
- Use **vLLM** or **TGI** with continuous batching to minimize idle GPU time.
- Apply **KV cache reuse** for longer context.
- **Quantize models** using bitsandbytes (4/8-bit) or GGUF to reduce memory footprint.
- Profile token latency using Prometheus + Grafana to find bottlenecks.

## 5. What strategies can you use to reduce hallucinations in deployed LLMs?

**Answer:**
- **RAG Integration:** Retrieve facts from vector databases like Weaviate or Qdrant.
- **Guardrails:** Use LLM-as-a-judge models to verify responses.
- **Prompt Engineering:** Include structured reasoning steps or use Chain-of-Thought prompts.
- **Uncertainty Estimation:** Use entropy or ensemble models to flag hallucinated outputs.

## 6. How do you A/B test two different LLM versions in production?

**Answer:**
- Randomly route a portion of traffic to the new model.
- Collect metrics: latency, helpfulness score, rejection rate, user feedback.
- Use tools like Feature Flags (LaunchDarkly) and metrics dashboards.
- Ensure statistical significance using hypothesis testing on user engagement data.

## 7. How do you handle multi-tenant inference where each customer wants private model access?

**Answer:**
- Use **Namespace isolation**: load separate LoRA adapters per tenant using PEFT.
- **Serve with vLLM or Triton**, mounting tenant-specific model weights.
- **Access Control:** Authenticate requests via API Gateway and enforce per-tenant usage limits.
- **Billing & Monitoring:** Track GPU time and token usage per tenant using OpenTelemetry.

---

## 8. How do you implement CI/CD for LLM workflows?

**Answer:**
- Use **GitOps** (e.g., ArgoCD) to sync model weights, configs, and prompts.
- Automate:
  - Model evaluation
  - Linting + static analysis of prompts
  - Canary release with rollback
- Version everything: model artifacts, prompts, datasets, tokenizer.

---

## 9. How do you monitor long-running LLMs with streaming outputs?

**Answer:**
- Stream outputs via WebSockets or Server-Sent Events (SSE).
- Track:
  - Time-to-first-token (TTFT)
  - Token generation rate
  - Output truncation or failure rate
- Use OpenTelemetry or Langfuse for tracing token-by-token generation.

---

## 10. What is your strategy to manage model and embedding versioning in RAG pipelines?

**Answer:**
- Use **Versioned Vector Stores**: Separate namespaces per embedding model version.
- Track:
  - Retrieval accuracy per version
  - Prompt-template compatibility
- Automate periodic re-embedding using Airflow or Prefect.
- Store complete RAG config (retriever + generator) in model registry.
