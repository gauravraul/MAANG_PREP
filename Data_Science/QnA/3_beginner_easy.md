## 1. What is data collection in Data Science?
**Answer:**  
Data collection is the process of gathering raw data from different sources to be used for analysis or modeling.

---

## 2. Why is data preprocessing important?
**Answer:**  
Preprocessing improves the quality of data by cleaning and formatting it, which helps in building accurate and reliable models.

## 3. What is missing data?
**Answer:**  
Missing data refers to the absence of values in a dataset, where certain fields or entries have no recorded information.
