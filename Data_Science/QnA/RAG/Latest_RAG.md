# 10 Advanced Hands-On RAG Interview Questions (2025 Edition)

These questions are crafted to evaluate deep, practical expertise in modern RAG systems across retrieval, optimization, orchestration, and evaluation.

---

## 1. Self-RAG Query Refinement

**Question:**  
How would you implement a self-improving RAG pipeline where the LLM rewrites user queries before retrieval? What criteria would you use to accept the rewritten query, and how would you evaluate its impact?

---

## 2. Hybrid Retrieval Optimization

**Question:**  
Describe a hybrid retrieval pipeline combining dense and sparse retrieval (e.g., FAISS + BM25). How would you balance the two during ranking, and which reranking technique would you use to fuse the results?

---

## 3. Memory-Augmented RAG Agent

**Question:**  
You're building a multi-turn RAG agent with long-term memory for a customer support chatbot. How would you design memory storage, retrieval strategies, and memory decay to avoid context overload?

---

## 4. Knowledge Graph + RAG Fusion

**Question:**  
You’ve been asked to integrate a knowledge graph into your RAG system. How would you ensure the retriever leverages both unstructured documents and structured triples? How would chunk prioritization work?

---

## 5. Compression-Aware Retrieval for 8k Token Budget

**Question:**  
Given a context window limit of 8k tokens and 20 relevant documents, how would you compress the context to maintain high answer quality? Would you compress before or after retrieval? Why?

---

## 6. Cross-Document Reasoning in Multi-Hop RAG

**Question:**  
How would you implement a multi-hop RAG system capable of reasoning across multiple documents for a fact-checking app? How would you trace reasoning chains and ensure intermediate consistency?

---

## 7. Prompt Attribution and Hallucination Defense

**Question:**  
What techniques would you apply to enforce **prompt-level source attribution** and reduce hallucination in RAG outputs? How would you log and evaluate attribution quality?

---

## 8. Domain Adaptation of Embedding Models

**Question:**  
You’ve noticed poor performance in RAG for legal documents. How would you fine-tune your embedding model to improve retrieval accuracy without degrading performance on general documents?

---

## 9. Retrieval Planning in Tool-Use Agents

**Question:**  
For an agentic RAG system using tools like calculators, search APIs, and vector databases, how would you implement retrieval planning to decide **when and how** to invoke retrieval mid-conversation?

---

## 10. Evaluating RAG Pipelines with RAGAS or TruLens

**Question:**  
How would you use RAGAS or TruLens to debug and score a failing RAG pipeline where users complain of irrelevant context? What metrics would you prioritize, and how would you use the scores to iterate?
