# Data Science - Day 7: Data Preprocessing - Easy Questions

## 1. What is data preprocessing?
**Answer:**  
Data preprocessing is the process of cleaning, transforming, and organizing raw data into a format suitable for analysis or modeling.

---

## 2. Why is data preprocessing important?
**Answer:**  
It ensures data quality, handles missing or inconsistent values, and prepares the data for better model performance.

---

## 3. Name three common tasks in data preprocessing.
**Answer:**  
- Handling missing values  
- Encoding categorical variables  
- Scaling or normalizing numerical data

---

## 4. What is missing value imputation?
**Answer:**  
It is the process of filling in missing data using techniques like mean, median, mode, or predictive models.

---

## 5. What is outlier detection?
**Answer:**  
Outlier detection involves identifying data points that deviate significantly from other observations in the dataset.

---

## 6. What is data normalization?
**Answer:**  
Normalization scales numerical values to a range, usually between 0 and 1.

---

## 7. What is the purpose of encoding categorical data?
**Answer:**  
Encoding converts categorical data into a numerical format so that it can be used in machine learning models.

---

## 8. What is data cleaning?
**Answer:**  
Data cleaning involves correcting or removing inaccurate, corrupted, or irrelevant parts of the dataset.

---

## 9. How do you handle duplicate values in a dataset?
**Answer:**  
Use functions like `.drop_duplicates()` in pandas to remove duplicated rows.

---

## 10. What is type conversion in data preprocessing?
**Answer:**  
Type conversion changes the data type of a feature, such as converting a string to an integer or datetime.
