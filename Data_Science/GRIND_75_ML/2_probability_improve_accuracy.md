# What approach would you take to adjust(calibrate) the probabilities generated by a classification model for better accuracy?


Calibrating probabilities for a classification model involves adjusting the predicted probabilities so that they better reflect the true likelihood of outcomes. To adjust(calibrate) probabilities we must re-scale the model values to get a better match with the distribution of the observed in the training data. This often involves splitting a training dataset and using one portion to train the model and another portion as a validation set to scale the probabilities.

Here’s how you can approach the calibration of probabilities:

Platt Scaling:

What it is: A method that fits a logistic regression model to the model's predicted probabilities. It is particularly effective for models like Support Vector Machines (SVMs).
How to use it: After training your classifier, you take the predicted probabilities and fit a logistic regression model (typically on a validation set) using these probabilities as inputs.


Steps:
Train your model and obtain the predicted probabilities on a validation set.
Fit a logistic regression model using these predicted probabilities as the input and the true labels as the target.
Use the logistic model to adjust the predicted probabilities.


Isotonic Regression:

What it is: A non-parametric method that fits a piecewise constant, non-decreasing function to the predicted probabilities.
How to use it: This method is useful when the relationship between predicted probabilities and the true likelihood is not well captured by a logistic function.
Steps:
Train your model and obtain the predicted probabilities on a validation set.
Fit an isotonic regression model using the predicted probabilities and the true labels.
Apply the isotonic regression model to the predicted probabilities to obtain the calibrated probabilities.
